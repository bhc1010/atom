## Introduction

Congradulations on purchasing your brand new STM AutoMator (SAM) 9000! This application is designed to control and manage an STM device, enabling users to perform various imaging and spectroscopy tasks. The application provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) and leverages the PySide6 library to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.

## Features

- Connect to an STM device using TCP/IP sockets.
- Control STM parameters such as bias voltage, scan area, line time, etc.
- Capture STM images with customizable scan size, position, and bias.
- Perform scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) with adjustable start, stop, and step values.
- Execute tasks sequentially or simultaneously.
- Background task execution using worker threads to maintain a responsive GUI.
- Custom GUI elements for clear visualization and interaction.
- Stylish UI with custom styling using QDarkTheme for an aesthetic experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the SAM 9000, you need the following installed on your system:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- PySide6 library (install via pip: `pip install PySide6`)
- (Include any other prerequisites or system dependencies here)
